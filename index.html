    In recent years, the issue of persistent gender inequality across different areas of life is becoming more and more visible. 
    </p>
    <p>
    One of the major problems that have been put on the map during the last decades is the pay gap. Women are consistently underpaid for the same jobs as men.

    <p>
    We have decided to look into the pay gap across different European countries and investigate whether the level of education may give an explanation for the payment differences. For example, higher-level education is believed to be one of the most important factors for finding a good job and getting a good salary. 
    </p>
    <p>
    We have investigated gender distribution in tertiary education and whether or not it correlates with the gender pay gap. What was discovered is that female students enrolled in tertiary education represent the majority in tertiary education all around Europe. 
    </p>
      <div class="flourish-embed flourish-map" data-src="visualisation/8305639"><script src="https://public.flourish.studio/resources/embed.js"></script></div> 
    <p>
    By looking at the data about the gender pay gap and the percentage of women enrolled in higher educations, we can detect clear trends. Women tend to represent the overall majority of students in higher education. However, in the professional world, their education doesn’t pay off. All across Europe, women are underpaid about 10 to 20% in comparison to men. This data allows us to talk about gender-based inequalities.
    </p>
    <p>
    However, the data that we have isn’t enough to explain why the inequality persists. For example, we didn’t investigate how many women that have obtained a Bachelor's or Master’s degree go on to continue their career in the academy to obtain a Ph.D. that can result in a better paid and prestigious career. We also don’t know about other potential factors that can cause such inequalities.
