<h1> Gender gap project
  <p>
    In recent years, the issue of persistent gender inequality across different areas of life is becoming more and more visible. 
One of the major problems that have been put on the map during the last decades is the pay gap. 
    Women are consistently underpaid for the same jobs as men or are encouraged to occupy low-qualified and, therefore, low-paid jobs. Nurses, caregivers, kindergarten and primary school teachers are considered to be ‘female’ jobs while politicians, professors, lawyers, and programmers are professions ‘for men’.  
We have decided to look into the pay gap across different European countries and investigate whether the level of education may give an explanation for the payment differences. For example, higher-level education is believed to be one of the most important factors for finding a good job and getting a good salary. 
We have investigated gender distribution in tertiary education and whether or not it correlates with the gender pay gap. What was discovered is that female students enrolled in tertiary education represent the majority in academies. We can see that why there are more educated women than men they still have to count on lower payments than their male counterparts.
